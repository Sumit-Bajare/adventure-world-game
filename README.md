### The Game Scenario:

This is the world of Goblins. There are various Dungeons spread across the world. Adventures raid the dungeons claim the treasure which is on the last floor of the dungeons. The adventurer is a Goblin Slayer who slays Goblins to claim the treasure. On each floor the player will have to complete certain task to unlock the next floor. The difficulty of the task increases with the increase in the floors.

Initially the player has 10,000 hit points (HP) , 0 Gold and 0 Healing Potions. Hit points are reduced when the adventurer gets attacked and suffers some damage, hit points are increase by drinking the healing potion. Each portion consists of 1,000 HP. The adventurer is carrying a backpack to store Healing portions and gold. Gold is used to buy items from the inventory. At the beginning of the game the backpack is empty. In this game the player will find various types of Goblins on each floor. Once you kill the Goblin the player will get gold or healing potions as reward.

The game is over in three scenarios:
1. The player chooses to quit the game.
2. The player loses all the hit points.
